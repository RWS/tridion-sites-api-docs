You can find all the information about working with the tridion-sites API in the RWS documentation portal . You may find there is some lag in rendering the pages to this documentation, please be patient. The plan is to move it to this site in the near future. What does the tridion-sites API cover? Scripting and Automation Scripting and Automation are powerful concepts to customize applications and integrate applications so that they work together like one single application. COM - Some background Using Sax Basic effectively requires that you should have a basic understanding of COM, component based computing and the tridion-sites Object Model. COM (the Component Object Model) is a binary standard for interfacing and interoperation of (possibly, separately-developed) components. More and more, everything Microsoft offers is COM-compliant. Automation of tridion-sites You can automate tridion-sites from any programming language that is able to connect to automation servers. Using automation, tridion-sites can be integrated into workflow management systems. Nearly every operation which is normally performed by a user can be automated without human interaction. Using Macros in tridion-sites Instead of using an external programming development tool, you can also use the scripting engine embedded in tridion-sites. The scripting engine is VBA compatible and includes an editor and a debugger. The System Macro In the dialog Macro you can select one of the available macros as the system macro. When you start the system macro with the command Tools / System Macro / Start System Macro this macro will be active all the time. When you work with tridion-sites some of the actions you perform will issue events. If the related call back handlers are defined in the system macro, these events can be processed. Automating other applications from tridion-sites In order to use another application in a tridion-sites macro, you should add a reference to the object. What's new in tridion-sites Automation This page contains the latest changes made to tridion-sites Automation. Getting help After having understood the basic principle of the object model, all you have to do is obtain some information about the names of all the objects and what properties and methods they have. This getting help section will explain how this is done."
